great keybindings: we are, in a sense, trying to make a really good *new style of thing*, which is kind of like a mix of a shell and a browser
    it's a "rich shell", perhaps?
    which people have experimented with, and which is cool
    but the interesting thing is that it might as well be able to *keep your focus in the text box*
    by doing that (and having enough keybindings to manipulate the rest), this could feel super powerful...
    you can fork from there, launch from there, navigate up and down the level of agents..
    the cmd-k switcher thing is really interesting for this reason...
