note: how to deal with suggestions / inline tasks:
    "Launch as subtask"
        this is the button text that we want on our suggestions
        then they show up there, AND they show up in the "subtasks" panel
        you WILL probably need a dialog anyway -- want to be able to configure the agent that is used, whether to include context, etc, etc
        so then in might as well just be "Launch..." or "Fix..."
    alt UI: just copy-paste, or push into text area
        could be a different little hover state or icon
    could probably just have both, see how they feel
if you launch a task from a task, it probably ought to be treated, by default, as a sort of subtask
    that's where we're going with forking and joining, snapshots, etc
    this is super powerful and important eventually, bc tasks need to be broken down, and that makes it eaiser to think about
    and that really ought to be a first class thing
