# sculptor user notification service

This module provides a service for sending notifications to users about various events in the Sculptor application.

We have learned that this is essential because we need to be able to notify users about important events, such as when an error occurs.

For now we can just save the notifications to the database, but in the future we may want tasks to deliver them via other channels.
