## What is Sculptor?

---

Sculptor is [Imbue](https://imbue.com)‚Äôs coding agent environment that allows you to run multiple coding agents simultaneously in safe,
isolated sandboxes. We‚Äôre currently beta testing Sculptor and are eager to hear what you think of it!

With Sculptor, you can:

- Run parallel agent tasks
- Interact with agents through an intuitive interface
- Work with your IDE of choice
