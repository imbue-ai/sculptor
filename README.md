# Sculptor: run parallel Claude Code agents in safe, local sandboxes

Sculptor lets you run simultaneous Claude Code agents in safe, isolated sandboxes. Sculptor runs locally, letting you iterate quickly in your chosen IDE without going through PRs. We‚Äôre currently alpha testing Sculptor and are excited to hear what you think!

### Kick off agents in parallel

Sculptor is a web UI for creating and managing multiple agents. Each agent runs in its own isolated sandbox with a clone of your repo, so you can experiment and make changes safely. Desktop app coming soon!

### Test & edit agent changes locally

Sync to any agent‚Äôs sandbox to instantly see its file changes in your local IDE. This lets you review, run, test, and edit the agent‚Äôs changes in your local environment while it's working in a sandbox, giving you the best of both worlds.

### Easily merge changes & resolve conflicts

Quickly merge the agent branches that you like. Sculptor agents can help you resolve any merge conflicts that arise.
